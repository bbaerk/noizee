# Noizee

An alternative to Noisli made in [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) 8.

## Development

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. If you wish to run the project inside a subfolder, run the `build-for-subfolder.bat` to build it to run under the `\noisli\` subfolder in your server.

## Contributing

Just do a pull request!

## TODO:

- Include an text editor, probably based on my already existent implementation of the CKEditor 5 that I put on ngx-Dumblog.
- Save the texts locally every so often on the browser's local storage then delete from there once you export your file.
- Think what formats I should add support to export. I don't plan anything fancy, probably TXT, HTML, JSON and maybe, MAYBE, PDF.
